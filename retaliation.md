  What damages does retaliation do to an organization?

  The most direct damage would be cost-wise. It makes victims operate at a higher risk. The costs associated with that would be counted towards the cost to hire the victims. Riskier jobs pay more.

They'd ask themselves if they could trust the goods / services provided by that organization. They'd question if they could trust their money with bad actors. Over time, both customer base and per-capita revenue shrinks as customers leave for more reliable alternatives and those who are willing to stay value the goods / services less.

  Needless to say what higher cost and lower revenue mean to an organization. It is no wonder that organizations try to do their best to fight retaliation. Some claim to have "zero tolerance" for it. But is that enough?

  Turns out, there's always a huge gap between ideal and real world.

  Because everybody knows retaliation is bad and anyone caught committing retaliation will be punished, retaliations almost always go stealth.
