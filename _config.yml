          Innovations include:
          - Antman - A web-based zoomable treemap of all service instances running within our infrastructure. This tool is quite versatile. For example, it provides also a grid (table) view of the instances, and connects to source control APIs to retrieve collaborator info of specific services, as well as to Jira APIs to submit and retrieve service-related issues. It runs real-time, reflecting instance statuses as they go up or down.
          - Grasshopper - A web-based SSH client that's capable of connecting users to specific hosts programatically, which enables it to work very well with the first tool. Users will basically be able to click on a button in Antman, and get into an ssh cli in the browser and land in the directory of the exact service he was inspecting in Antman, eliminating the need to open Putty or mRemote.
          - Documentary - An API documentation aggregation server which exposes a web interface where a list of the aggregated documentations are displayed. Clicking one of the items opens up swagger UI in an iframe beneath the list that displays an interactive API documentation of that item (service).

  - title: On Innovation
    layout: text
    content: |
      Most organizations / teams tend to confuse innovation with technology, thinking technology means innovation. The more advanced technologies you use, the better you can innovate. And that's why a lot of teams focus their attention on technology. But is that the right thing to do?

      IMHO, innovations are often realized through technological means, which means technology is only the means to the end. Innovation should be based on real life needs. Those tangible needs are the source of inspiration for innovations. Innovation should be led and driven by those needs. If we're able to solve real world problems in creative and effective ways, then it doesn't really matter how much technology is involved.

  - title: On Incentive Management
    layout: text
    content: |
      In a factory operated 100% by machines, you feed them electricity and they work. How much they work depends on how much electricity is fed. But if we treat humans as machine-like resources (I guess that's why we use the term "human resource"), using money (like electricity) as the sole means to drive them, then we'd be missing a lot of potential efficiency and loyalty. I believe this "factory mindset" is exactly the primary culprit behind so many teams' low morale and high attrition rate. If managing humans is as easy as managing machines, then why do we need managers at all?

      Innovation, for example, is one such area where more money doesn't necessarily mean more productivity. You can't say "I'll pay you X amount of money and please give me Y number of innovations by date Z". Apart from "problem / need discovery ability" mentioned above, another important moving factor here is <mark>incentive</mark>. Are your people willing to innovate? Do they feel safe to innovate? Why not?

      How about sharing? Are your developers willing to offer help to rest of the team? Do they have a collective success / failure mindset?

      How about morale? Do your developers offer to do what's above and beyond what they're assigned to? Are they willing to take on more responsibilities than described in the JD? Are they speaking their minds during work?

  - title: On Agile
    layout: text
    content: |
      Agile is the de facto most widely used software development methodology. But not all teams are making good use of it. I've been in both bad and good agile teams. Bad teams use daily standups to gather progress information, thinking Agile is a way to magically make things go faster. The most frequently asked question in a bad Agile team is "What's the ETA?". In a good Agile team, the scrum master never asks this question because s/he knows the answers better than anyone else. A bad scrum master doesn't know exactly what developers are working on, but his / her job is full of certainty - kick people so they deliver. A good scrum master's daily routines are filled with uncertainty. Things could deviate from plans. Better, more efficient solutions might be discovered as the team progresses. And that's the gist of Agile - proceed, review, incrementally and continuously improve.

  - title: On Process
    layout: text
    content: |
      Messenger is world's favorite guy to murder. When things go right, it's thanks to the managers. When things go wrong, messengers are first to blame. And because we never run out of innocent messengers, we never learn to discover the flaws in our processes. I found 99% of the time when things go wrong, it's due to process. Lack of guidelines, resources, culture for instance all contribute to failures. If a process has flaws in it, then however many messengers we swap, failure is the fate. We sometimes do get a few decent messengers who are able to make up for the flaws, but we shouldn't take it for granted. We should actively seek to spot and fix the flaws in our processes instead of relying on individuals. Otherwise we put team / project's sustainability at risk.

  - title: On Feedback Management
    layout: text
    content: |
      Feedback is one of the most important incentives employees receive. Positive feedbacks give them incentives to do more of the good stuff while negative ones do the opposite. Receiving no feedback means the employees are blindfolded, guessing their way out, and good luck with that.

      A performance review session, for example, is essentially a set of feedbacks given to an employee. It's therefore crucial to keep those feedbacks whole and fair. That is, we shouldn't miss out on or distort them. Otherwise we create wrong incentives for employees to follow.
