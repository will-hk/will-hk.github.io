  In game theory, Prisoner's Dilemma refers to a situation in which 2 arrested criminals acting in their own best interests end up getting the worst outcome for both.

  The quadrant looks like:

  If we only look at this from A's perspective, and choose to stay silent (the upper half of the quadrant), we either get to serve 1 or 3 years, averaging 2. On the other hand, if we choose to betray B (the lower half of the quadrant), we get to serve either 0 or 2 years, averaging 1. At this point, the choice is obvious for A. So is it for B. Their natural incentives are to betray each other in favor of their own best interests. We call this the default case.

  However, before committing the crime, they could have agreed upon a plan B in which if they get caught, both would stay silent in order to achieve the best outcome as a team. And here's when things become interesting...

  A knows B has agreed to stay silent but isn't sure if B would cheat. If B does, then the best for A is to cheat as well (bottom right quadrant), otherwise A gets 3 years (top right quadrant). There's an ambiguity here for both A and B. In fact they might still end up in the worst case scenario even if they have verbally agreed to strive for the best outcome. Unless they trust each other like Bonnie and Clyde, there needs to be a mutually binding mechanism to force them to commit to the agreement in order to get rid of the ambiguity. Something like a smart contract that enforces the execution of the agreed plan. Something that gives both parties crystal clear incentives.

  In modern corporate world, there exists a small group of people who we call innovators. They love to challenge the norm. They're not content with how things are done traditionally. They're good at spotting inefficiencies and flaws in seemingly normal processes and coming up with effective ways to deal with them. Some of their innovations could be so disruptive that they completely change the industry. These innovations then typically become products and get fundings from venture capitals, IPOs, etc. Majority of the innovations, however, wouldn't get to that scale. In fact, they might just stay unnoticed throughout their lifetime.

  Why, you might wonder, would an innovator hide something they're proud of from rest of the world? Wouldn't it be great to share those innovations and make the world an easier place for everyone?

  Imagine you're an analyst whose job is to extract data from several internal and external systems, consolidate it, render it into some meaningful form and prepare it for presentation. The goal is straight forward, but the implementation is tedious. You have to login to dozens of systems, sift through each looking for data you need, copying them out into a central place, apply several transformation functions to get to meaningful form, and then finally chart it for visualization. Better yet, you're assigned to do this weekly as data constantly updates.

  One day, you decide enough is enough. There's no way you waste life like this. You decide to program a tool that does majority of the work for you. One month later you have it running smoothly churning out charts after charts like a piece of cake. The work that used to take you a week to do now takes less than half an hour as pretty much everything is automated. You'll just have to do some verifications.

  Just before you struggle with how to enjoy life with the time saved, there's something else you're already struggling with. Should you share the tool with rest of the team? If you do, there could be several possibilities.

  a) You're promoted to do innovations full-time enhancing team's capacity over time. The culture also encourages everyone to be innovative. It turns into a positive cycle attracting more funding for the team. The cake becomes bigger for everyone
  b) You're still an analyst. All analysts in the team get to work half an hour a week and still get paid the same. The cake stays the same
  c) Everyone else gets fired. You get to keep your job to maintain the tool and do verifications and get a meager increment. The cake shrinks
  d) Your manager decides they want to become an analyst. The cake disappears

  Which is to say by default, the possible outcome of sharing the innovation could lie anywhere between benefiting everybody and benefiting nobody. It'll be a hard choice to make.

  Innovators are faced with the dilemma of whether they should share the innovations or not. In a team with no culture or rules around innovation, i.e. in default case, innovations are likely to go stealth because there's a high probability they cause scenario c) or d) above. If innovators get some verbal promises, they might be willing to share some of their works but they'd still be reluctant, because verbal agreements are not mutually binding and enforced. In a culture where incentives around innovation are properly recognized and addressed and made crystal clear, innovations sprout and thrive from all corners.

  Innovation is a type of what I call "voluntary value" (VV), but it's not the only one. Voluntary value has below characteristics:

  - It's incentive driven and cannot be enforced. We can't say someone's paid to realize voluntary value.
  - It's impossible to quantify until realization. Think about iPhone. Everybody wanted a better version of Nokia until they used the first iPhone. Back then, Apple wouldn't have thought by Q4 2022, iPhone would account for 47.3% of its revenue.
  - It's cost efficient, because of the incentive-driven nature.

  Good news is, it's not necessarily expensive to get the incentives right to realize VV. At least the basics are common sense, such as maintaining a fair and transparent culture, making sure achievements are seen and getting feedbacks, avoiding shading practices, etc. It's then down to each team's specific objectives to decide what to be implemented to realize that VV potential. The objectives don't have to be "incentive-driven only" initiatives such as innovation. They could well be things that used to be considered "mandatory value". Can we add a VV component to it to reduce friction and cost? Can we tweak certain parts of our processes to align with our talents' best interests? Can we establish a DAO-like mechanism to minimize micro-management?
