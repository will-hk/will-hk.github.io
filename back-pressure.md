  Back pressure is a term used in the reactive programming paradigm to refer to situations where the consumer of data is overloaded and needs the producer to slow down.

  This concept applies very well to the Scrum methodology. In a Scrum setup, the ability of a pod to create and control that back pressure against requirement producers determines the wellbeing and longevity of the pod / project, and therefore is crucial.

  What happens when you accomplish sprint goals ahead of time? What do you do with the extra time you gained? My experience tells me, what we do with this "breathing room" could make a huge difference.

  We could of course pull stuff from the backlog into the sprint and continue churning along, working on stuff in advance that are meant to go into later sprints. But to me that's the worst way we could spend that precious breathing room. We should do it rather sparingly and shouldn't take it for granted. We should only do it when absolutely necessary, such as when we're pushed against a tight deadline.

  Another issue with pulling stuff from the backlog is that it doesn't create a positive incentive. Individual contributors are rewarded with more work for being efficient...

  What we can do instead is to treat it as a great opportunity to reflect upon what has been done, both within the current and previous sprints. Is there something that causes pain every time we are forced to work with it? Is there code we fail to cover with test for some reason? Is there a wheel we reinvented that can be replaced with well thought out / battle tested solutions. Is there something we could have done differently to make maintenance easier?

  Here's an analogy. Imagine you're in the jungle and starving. You've been searching for food and can barely make ends meet. God bless you run into an apple tree. Instead of being forced to run around trying to find a source of food, you now have the food that could support you for quite a while. Wouldn't it be great if you use this opportunity to start sowing seeds and planting trees? It surely won't help you in the immediate short-term, but it'll ensure that you won't have to worry about food in the future.

  The moment a Scrum pod learns to create back pressure, it ceases to be a disposable machine and becomes part of the decision making process and a smart delivery engine with optimized efficiency.

  I hope this inspires both pod facilitators and requirement producers to think differently.
